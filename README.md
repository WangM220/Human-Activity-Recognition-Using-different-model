The dataset is available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and consists of sensor data collected from a group of 30 volunteers performing six different activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) while wearing a smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. 
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
